Frontend Test Task
Let's build a simple PLP (Product Listing Page) like this  https://tourparavel.com/t/classic/cadet.
The task is divided into two subtasks:

1. Filters:
- there should be two dropdowns - CATEGORY and COLOR
- each dropdown should have at least 3 options
- only a single dropdown can be visible at a time
- dropdown is a multi select (can have more than one selected value)
- we don't have to display selected filters as in the example (selection on a dropdown is sufficient)

2. Products:
- should change on a filter change and should consider multiple filters
- every product should have more than 3 colors
- colors are clickable and click should change the color of the product
- the image and price of a product should change on a color change
- any features besides colors changing should be ignored

Required technology:
- React
- Webpack (we can use boilerplate)
- ES6 and beyond

Additional information:
- products should be stored statically as an array in a js variable
- the data structure of products is up to you to decide
- backend isnâ€™t required for this task

Bonus points for:
- using Redux (https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
- using BEM (http://getbem.com/)
- fancy styling
- using sass (http://sass-lang.com/)
- RWD
- JavaScript tests

The task should be built on `create-react-app` boilerplate (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and the solution should be hosted on GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com/) as a static website. Send us links to the solution and the source code. Thank you!
